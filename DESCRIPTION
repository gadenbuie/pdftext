Title: Extract Text from Text- and Image-based PDFs
Version: 0.2.1
Authors@R: person("Jacob", "Malcom", email = "jmalcom@defenders.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A large batch of PDFs may contain a mix of text-based and image-
    based PDFs, and one needs to extract the text from all of these files for
    analysis. This package offers a single primary function to perform text
    extraction from PDFs by trying the poppler library's wrapper in pdftools;
    if that fails, then Imagemagick, unpaper, and Tesseract are used to perform
    Optical Character Recognition.
